## Plan (5 min)

> define skeloton of component and rough diagram on paper

## Installation

```sh
npx create react app my-youtube
npm run start
```

Use create-react-app good because it save times that parcel install; Find difference between npm and npx
Search for reportWebVitals.js, react strict mode

## Clear unwanted code

    > clear unwanted code in app.js & app.js and check all is working

## setup tailwind

```sh
npm i -D tailwindcss
npx tailwind init
```

no need to install postcss because create react-app takes care of it

> Add file extension in tailwindcss.config.js

```
"./src/**/*.{js,jsx}"
```

no curly bracket if single extension is used

> clear app.css and following Code

```

```

check it is working properly
